    <p class="text-xs sm:text-base font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
        It was started in August 1996. Some years after that, I began loving computers.
        During middle school, I coded my first computer program with C++.
        After that, I started learning algorithms also because of another personal interest in mathematics.
        When I reached 18 and finished high school, I went to Isfahan University of Technology to study computer engineering with a major in hardware engineering, which was interesting to me at that moment.
        At the end of my bachelor's program, I found that I love hardware,  I love to work with them, and I love to learn about them and their architecture, but I'm not interested in designing them very much.
        Instead of designing them, I love using them efficiently with appropriate algorithms based on a deep understanding of how they work.
        On the other hand, I believe my bachelor's program gave me an excellent vision to follow hardware documentation and find how they work and are designed.
        Because of these facts, I continued my study in computer science.
        Right now, I've recently graduated from Sahid Beheshti University, where I was studying computer science with major in Algorithms and Computing Theory.
        I believe in learning new things and using the power of computers to solve other science problems, so I worked in bioinformatics for my master's Thesis.
